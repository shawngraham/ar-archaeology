# Augment your archaeology
<small> Follow along on your own device at http://j.mp/ar-arch
<br>Fork & annotate & remix the source at http://j.mp/ar-arch-source</small>

Note:
Why bother with AR? Ain't it just a gimmick? Make a Pratchett allusion - Tiffany Aching- Open your eyes, then open them again? Should also perhaps map out the parts of this talk


## Map for Today's Talk

1. Seeing Ghosts 
2. Which We've Always Done
    + I want my MTV
3. Sense and Sensibility (_or, manipulating breaks in presence_)
4. AR for Archaeological Research
5. AR for Public Archaeology
6. WIIFM

Note:
We've always been augmenting reality. But maybe we could make things a bit more... awesome. image: http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/cakes-cottages-and-manky-bones/

...consider the Museum Diorama...

Note:
Stu Eve app. This video continues to blow me away. No AR app I've seen in the intervening years comes as close.

## the continuum

Note:
from your smartphone to disney world to the oculus & hololens. archaeologists have always been working along this continuum.

### Ok, so much for the hype.
# _Nihil novi sub sole_
Note: this ends the intro; having looked at the geewhiz aspects, let's turn to the things that have been constant


## analogue AR
From Wall Painting to Flipbooks

![roman tromp l'oeil - second style](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Metropolitan_wall_painting_Roman_1C_BC_9.jpg/576px-Metropolitan_wall_painting_Roman_1C_BC_9.jpg) ![acetate](http://i.imgur.com/rGyEOdL.jpg)


## analogue VR

Stereoscopes

![stereoscope](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Holmes_stereoscope.jpg/487px-Holmes_stereoscope.jpg)


...and no doubt you can think of more examples...


## thing is, we were promised this

discussion of early vr, caves, etc

### but we got this

### 3. What gets augmented, anyway? 
## privileging the visual
![JC+A, British Museum https://www.flickr.com/photos/williamphotography/](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4023/4672892333_dd110d9d17_z.jpg)
Note: 
Something about the gaze etc. also, about touch - that tweet of lidar + pins hmmmm


## Breaks in Presence
+ that which knocks you out of the experience
+ What can 'ruin' a conventional AR experience?
![this child has had a break in presence](http://i.imgur.com/aZYsJmP.png)

<small>This child has endured a break in presence.<br>https://pixabay.com/en/portrayal-portrait-crying-cry-baby-89189/</small>

Note:
Building a convincing visual AR experience, that does not cause any breaks in presence is the holy grail of Augmented Reality studies, and something that is virtually impossible to achieve. A break in presence will occur due to the mediation of the experience through a device (Head-Mounted Display, tablet computer, smartphone, etc.); the quality of the rendering of the virtual objects; the level of latency in software that delivers the experience to the eyes; the list is endless and scale-less – once you ‘solve’ one break in presence, then another occurs. The goal then can never be to completely eliminate breaks in presence, but instead to recognise them and treat them with an historian’s caution.

## missing a trick: sound & AR
+ sound is haptic
+ sound requires active attention
+ sound is spatialized
+ can use it to deliberately play with BiPs


## Some Augmented Audio Links

|---|---|---|

Note:
audio tours - yes, I suppose they are a kind of AR, but see paper


#### voices recognition

Note: 
Caitlin Fisher's work: note the importance of sound in creating the ambiance/immersiveness in her art/work https://projeqt.com/caitlin/200-castles


### 4. AR in archaeological research
## A Very Brief Tour.
_just to give you a sense of what's out there_

### 5. AR for the public
## Of course, these categories smear, don't they.


...'bringing impossible places to the public'... 

http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opar.2014.1.issue-1/opar-2015-0007/opar-2015-0007.xml?format=INT
Note: 
the assetts that this project creates could be rendered into AR easily; here they're being sent to a 3d printer...


...Pop-up books...

+ HIST5702x & FYSM1405a, digitizing museum collections
_get the book_: http://5702x.graeworks.net/?p=789
<br>_student reflections:_ http://scalar.usc.edu/works/hist5702x-unessays-winter-2014/index

...museums...
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/COXL3d8h.jpg)


...AR Sandtable...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm4o3zn0JC8

Kinect + Digital Projector + cheap linux box = very very cool

Note:
Many of these things out there, and this is more hydrological than archaeological, but we can see the potentials, right?


...Ghosts in the Garden...

[![Ghosts in the Garden](http://www.react-hub.org.uk/sites/default/files/imagecache/project-380/project/key_image/2012-03-13/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-25%20at%2016.11.52.png)](http://apps.watershed.co.uk/mediaembedder/?id=1938&store=dds&theme=default&autoplay=false&autobuffer=false)

http://www.react-hub.org.uk/heritagesandbox/projects/2012/ghosts-in-the-garden/

Note: 
Also excursus into Techumseh Lies Here & ARGs. This is a lovely mixture of place & audio, makes a compelling experience


...Low friction AR...

Note: 
My attempt at making a 'ghosts in the garden' type experience



## 6. Conclusion:
### What's in it for you
- why you should bother
- the research potentials


- the public outreach potentials
- the rhetorical/tactical impact
- the problem of publishing [more about Digital Gabii]


## This afternoon:
+ Building an AR app in Unity3d with Vuforia
_or_
+ Building a location-based game (with sound!) in Twine
_or_
+ Making 3d models with 123d Catch; annotating & sharing them in Sketchfab (with Oculus or Cardboard viewing!)
